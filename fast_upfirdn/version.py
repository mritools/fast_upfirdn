Fast Upfirdn
============
The core low-level function implemented here is an equivalent of
``scipy.signal.upfirdn`` but with support for both CPU (via NumPy) and GPU
(via CuPy).

The version of ``upfirdn`` here supports several signal extension modes. These
have been contributed upstream to SciPy and are available there for SciPy 1.4+.
